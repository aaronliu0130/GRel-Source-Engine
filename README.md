# GRel Source Engine
List of domains used by a CSE that only includes generally-reliable sources and excludes user-generated and opinion content that can be filtered out based on domain. Does not include journals, as RSP doesn't really list journals either; use Google Scholar for that. Fork of SuperbOwl's Reliable Source Engine.
