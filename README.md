# GRel Source Engine
List of domains used by a CSE that only includes generally-reliable sources and excludes user-generated and opinion content that can be filtered out based on domain. Does not include journals, as RSP doesn't really list journals either; use Google Scholar for that. Fork of SuperbOwl's Reliable Source Engine.

## Notes on GRel sources that aren't included at all

There's probably more, but I forgot them, thank you very much.

* LWN.net (Linux weekly news): URLs for mailing list archives are indistinguishable from actual articles, even as the page layout is so visually distinct.
